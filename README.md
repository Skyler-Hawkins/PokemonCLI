The Pokemon DB CLI is an interactive interface into the Pokemon Database. This database consists of relevant Pokemon information such as the Pokemon itself, Types, Abilities, Pokedex Entries, and more! It is an interactive tool that can be used to efficiently query and interpret data from Pokemon.

# How it works
The user must supply a valid postgres DB and password. 
From there, a user can run given DDL Commands to recreate the DB on their device. 
In the repo, the .csv files are given.
